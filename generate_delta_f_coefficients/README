The script generate_vh_coeff.sh will pull the pdg list of resonances from 
PDG/pdg.dat and generate the corresponding 14 moment and Chapman Enskog coefficients
(these depend on the HRG).
By default these coefficients are calculated with the smash list of resonances.

To run iS3D with a different list, one should 

1. copy the new pdg file to PDG/pdg.dat

2. run generate_vh_coeff.sh

3. run iS3D
